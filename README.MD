This project is intended for personal use, i am not responsibile for any damage to your machine.

My intention was to make this application cross-operating-system but i have tried it only on Linux.

This application won't save nothing of the data you give.

DESCRIPTION:

To run the application properly you need to specify:

===>ACCESS_TOKEN to your dropbox account

===>RELATIVE PATH to DROPBOX directory (EXAMPLE : university/operating system)

===>RELATIVE PATH to LOCAL MACHINE (EXAMPLE: Desktop/university/op_System).
MAKE SURE not to put the / or \ before the first directory


This application will download on your local machine the dropbox files. It also recursevly goes to every subDirectory and does the same.
