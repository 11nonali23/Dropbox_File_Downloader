# PERSONAL DROPBOX FILE DOWNLOADER



##Warnings

This project is intended for personal use, i am not responsibile for any damage to your machine.

My intention was to make this application cross-operating-system but i have tried it only on Linux.


##Goal of the project

This application was created to automate the annoying process of downloading the annotations that i take on RocketBook on my local machine


##Description

This application will download on my local machine the dropbox files in the directory i specify. It also recursevly goes to every subDirectory and does the same.

After development i have created a jar with maven-shade-plugin and a bash file to run this program whenever i need.
