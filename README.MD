# PERSONAL DROPBOX FILE DOWNLOADER

This application was created to automate the annoying process of downloading the annotations that i take on RocketBook on my local machine

## Warnings

This project is intended for personal use, i am not responsibile for any damage to your machine.

My intention was to make this application cross-operating-system but i have tried it only on Linux.


## Description

This application will download on my local machine the dropbox files in the directory i specify. It also recursevly goes to every subDirectory and does the same.

I have understanded and used authorization code from * [Github auth example](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-java/tree/master/examples) - Github page

I have used ANSI code to make the application prettier on linux machines.

After development i have created a jar with maven-shade-plugin and a bash file to run this program whenever i need.
