DROPBOX FILE DOWNLOADER

##Warnings

This project is intended for personal use, i am not responsibile for any damage to your machine.

My intention was to make this application cross-operating-system but i have tried it only on Linux.


##Description

This application will download on my local machine the dropbox files in the directory i specify. It also recursevly goes to every subDirectory and does the same.

After development i have created a jar and a bash file to run this program when i need.
